Hello! This is a repository for a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) robot for the CENTERSTAGE game, but built in the off-season during the summer. It was demoed at an event hosted by my local library system.

The robot started with a strafer chassis, cable-driven viper slides, a claw and a wrist.

The new robot has belt-driven viper slides, but the slides rotate for horizontal extension and height. The new claw can grab two pixels at once.

Below are some videos of the robot working. It is mostly built off of COTS goBILDA parts.
